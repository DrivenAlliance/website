# What it is
In this two day workshop, facilitated by people that have been on the journey and have helped many others along the way, we teaching people from all parts of your organisation the basics of what is really about Agile. We run both in-house and public bootcamps.

# What it can do for you
Understanding the key principles of Agile is useful when forming the mental models that you use in your work systems. We address the many myths around Agile and what it really looks like in practice through a mix of theoretical learning and interactive simulations covering some of the popular frameworks in use today like Scrum and Kanban.
