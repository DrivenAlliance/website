# Agile Bootcamp Introduction
Applying, and teaching people from all parts of the organisation the basics of Agile in a 2 day bootcamp, by people that have been on the journey and have helped many others along the way. 

Understanding the key principles of Agile is useful when forming the mental models that people use in work systems. There are many myths around Agile and what it really looks like which we address in the 2 day bootcamp through a mix of theoretical learning and interactive simulations covering some of the popular frameworks in use today like Scrum and Kanban.  

# Some topics covered
Over the 2 days, we cover many topics that we trust will be the foundation required to start your Agile journey. Some topics covered are:

* Forming a Team/Working Agreements
* The history of Agile Manifesto
* Overview of Agile and some of the frameworks in use
* The Scrum Framework
* Scrum Flow, Ceremonies and Artefacts
* Scrum Roles - Product Developers, Scrum Masters and Product Owner
* Sprint Planning and Estimation
* Daily Standups, Sprint Reviews and Retrospectives
* Understanding the principles of WIP, Flow and Waste
* Kanban

# When to request it
When parts of your organisation are using an Agile approach to deliver software, particularly the technology areas, it is extremely useful for the rest of the organisation to understand the "why" on how the teams are working in order for them to support agility. 

If your organisation is using an agile approach and you would like to understand more about it or require a refresher, attending an Agile Bootcamp will be highly valuable.

# Duration
