# What it is
In this workshop, facilitated by the people who created the [Spine Model](http://spinemodel.info), we teach you to apply this powerful sensemaking framework effectively.

# What it can do for you
Understanding the Spine Model and how to apply it assists you to create a shared understanding of your human work system – how it currently is, how it should be and concrete steps to get there. It also provides a powerful interpersonal conflict resolution mechanism for the journey.

# When to request it
Understanding the Spine Model is useful for any context where...

* You need people to collaborate in order to get work done to achieve a common purpose. 
* You need to reach and maintain agreement on how to get work done, across team(s) or department(s)
* You would like people to intentionally grow their technical skills to an expert level in their field.

# Duration
This is a full day interactive workshop.

# Cost
