# Team Bootstrapping
A Team Bootstrap process focusses on the core foundations of a team, and is an indispensable part of forming people into a cohesive unit that knows how to collaborate well.

The Team Bootstrap has the following outcomes:

* The opportunity for everyone in the team to understand *why* everyone else is there
* What the *needs* are of everyone in order for them to be fully committed to the team
* The behaviours that are expected from each other as a team
* A team / social contract that captures the discussions of the day
The Team Contract answers this question: *"What do you personally need to be in place, to be on this team?”*. This contract can then be applied to help each other stay checked into the team.

# When to request it
The best time to bootstrap a team is when they are newly forming as a team. Other appropriate times are when there has been a change in team membership or the team feels like they have drifted apart, they are not pulling together or conflict is not being dealt with in a healthy way.

# Cost
When done as part of a full coaching engagement, these sessions are charged at a rate of **R 1ﾠ368** per coach per hour.

When done outside of a coaching engagement:

* **R 2 700** / person for small groups (5 – 12 attendees)

This teaming process does not work for groups larger than 12, and we recommend an ideal team size of 5-7 for an optimal result.
