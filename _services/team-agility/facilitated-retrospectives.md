# What it is
Driven facilitated retrospectives are a very effective team or department level learning sessions. We recommend one hour every two weeks for delivery teams, and a slightly longer cadence for leadership teams, to create effective feedback at all levels.

# What it can do for you
We believe this is one of our biggest impact offerings. In Driven facilitated retrospectives...

* We create a space for courageous feedback and actively changing the system in small and effective increments. 
* We enable double loop learning to understand not simply how actions are linked to outcomes, but more powerfully how mindset is linked to actions. 
* We assist in creating a culture of inspect-and-adapt, where the people doing the work own and continually improve the way they work.

# When to request them
Any time you need people to collaborate in a healthy way in order to get work done to achieve a common purpose. 

# Cost

* **R 1 100** / person per session for small groups (5 – 12 attendees)
* **R 800** / person per session for larger groups (11 – 20 attendees) 

\* When done as part of a full coaching engagement these sessions are charged at the hourly rate of the coach involved.
