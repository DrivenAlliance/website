[request a facilitated retrospective]()

# Facilitated RetrospectivesDriven facilitated retrospectives are a very effective team or department level practice. They create a space for courageous feedback and actively changing the system in small and effective increments. They enable double loop learning to understand not simply how actions are linked to outcomes, but more powerfully how mindset is linked to actions. They assist in creating a culture of inspect-and-adapt, where the people doing the work own and continually improve the way they work.
# When to request them
Any time you need people to collaborate in order to get work done to achieve a common purpose. We believe this is one of our biggest impact offerings. We recommend one hour every two weeks for delivery teams, and a slightly longer cadence for leadership teams, to create effective feedback at all levels.# Cost
When done as part of a full coaching engagement, these sessions are charged at a rate of **R 1ﾠ368** per coach per hour.

When done outside of a coaching engagement:

* **R 1 100** / person for small groups (5 – 12 attendees)* **R 800** / person for larger groups (11 – 20 attendees)
